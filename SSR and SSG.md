-Definition:
SSR is a method of rendering web pages on the server instead of the client. With SSR, the server generates the complete HTML for a page for each request and sends it to the client.

Server-Side Generation is a technique where HTML pages are generated on the server at build time. This approach creates static files from server-rendered templates, allowing the pre-generated HTML to be served directly to the client.


-Choose SSR when you need dynamic content that changes frequently and requires up-to-date information on each request.

-Choose SSG when you want fast, secure, and scalable pages with content that doesnâ€™t change often or can be updated periodically.
