-Definition:
SSR is a method of rendering web pages on the server instead of the client. With SSR, the server generates the complete HTML for a page for each request and sends it to the client.


-Choose SSR when you need dynamic content that changes frequently and requires up-to-date information on each request.

-Choose SSG when you want fast, secure, and scalable pages with content that doesnâ€™t change often or can be updated periodically.
